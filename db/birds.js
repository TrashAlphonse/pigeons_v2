        "name": "Rock dove",
        "summary": "The rock dove (feral pigeon) is the wild ancestor of domestic pigeons the world over, domesticated originally to provide food. Feral pigeons come in all shades, some bluer, others blacker - some are pale grey with darker chequered markings, others an unusual shade of dull brick-red or cinnamon-brown. Others can be or less white while others look exactly like wild rock doves. In urban areas where the numbers are allowed to increase they are sometimes considered a nuisance.",
        "food": "Seeds and cereals",
        "habitat": "The wild rock dove is now found only along the north and west coasts of Scotland, on islands and on Northern Ireland coasts. Feral, or domestic, pigeons breed almost everywhere apart from upland areas, with the highest density in the most populated urban and suburban areas."
